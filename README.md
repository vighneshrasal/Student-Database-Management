# Student-Database-Management(This is currently under development)
In this Java programe I have created a Student Database Management System. The System will involve the name, course, student id, grade year, cost of course.

1. The student first will have to provide their name.
2. Then their grade in which they are studying.
3. Using this it will create a unique student id.
