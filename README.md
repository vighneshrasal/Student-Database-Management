# Student-Database-Management
In this Java programme I have created a Student Database Management System. The System will involve no. of Students, their name, course, student id, grade year, cost of course, and their payment of courses.

1. The number of students need to enter thier data.
1. The student will have to provide their name.
2. Then their grade in which they are studying.
3. Using this it will create a unique student id.
4. Then students will select which Subjects do they want.
5. After selecting subjects they would be prompted to pay the fees.
6. In the end all the information will be printed.
